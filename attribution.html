<h2> The Experts !! </h2>
<p>
For a bunch of students who just started crawling in synthetic biology, taking a plunge in iGEM and developing the project in unforgettable Covid times was one of a kind experience for us. We are indebted to the relentless guidance and support received from these experts.
</p>
<br>
<h2> Dr. Kapila Kumar (Principal Investigator): Assistant Professor, Department of Biotechnology Faculty of Engineering & Technology Manav Rachna International Institute of research and Studies Faridabad, Haryana, INDIA
</h2>
<p> 
It was under the able guidance of Dr. Kumar that the team was born and students across different specializations came together to work on the project. Her specialization lies in Functional Genomics and  molecular biology. She has been a government sponsored trainee in Synthetic Biology.
</p>


<br>

<br>
<h2> Dr. Krishnamoorthy Kanan (Instructor):Chair Professor- Biotechnology, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, Manav Rachna International Institute of Research and Studies.

<h2>
Chander Shekhar-’ Bulbasaur’
 

</h2>
<p>
I’m ‘Balbasaur’  of my team. I have been the member of the wiki designing team. Like bulbasaur I am go-get-it-done member of my team. Through iGEM, I alongwith my fellow wiki mate have learnt new faces of synthetic biology and IT forms an integral part of it all.
</p>

<h2>
Mrugank Dake (Advisor):

</h2>
<p>
Currently in my final year of Masters’, I was a part of the first iGEM Team from IISER Tirupati in 2019. I served as a team leader, and was an active member of wet lab with some contributions to the modelling. In the initial days, I was a major contributor in the idea development and team formation. The project was recognized by iGEM with a Gold Medal at Giant Jamboree 2019.
</p>
<p>
As an advisor/mentor for the team MRIIRS_Faridabad iGEM 2020, I have played a role of troubleshooter for modelling and wetlab. I have also shared my experience from iGEM 2019 to help the new team set and design their goals and timelines.

</p>

<br>

<h3> Special Note of Thanks: </h3>

<p> 
From the time of inception of our team in December 2019 and the well planted idea of participating in iGEM 2020, we approached ex-iGEM applicants. Mrugank has been with us since then and helped us in numerous ways. Being a former Team Leader himself, he mentored us and valuable insights from technical stuff to non-technical buffs. Our team shall be forever grateful.
</p>
<h3> Helping Hands: </h3>
<p> <b>
During the entire course of iGEM; a lot generous souls helped us in shaping our project.

<p> We presented our project in front of him. He also agreed with our project and told us Nitrosamines are really a problem for mankind.  He appreciated us a lot and said this project should be taken forward to solve this problem. </p>


<p> 
    
<li><h2>Tarun, Robin Hood Army.</h2></li>
<img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/c/ca/T--mriirs_faridabad--team1de5.jpg"  style="width:300px;height:300px;">
<p>Dr. MC Gupta belongs to the community of scientists in the field of agriculture. As many crops like spinach also absorb nitrosamines from water at the time of irrigation and being a one of the main staple crops, this problem should be solved, according to him. His words really mean a lot for us.
</p>

<p> 
For Human Practices, we want to spread awareness not only in kids who are pursuing education, but also to the kids who are not getting the opportunity to take education. For this purpose, we met Tarun, one of the members of Robin Hood Army, a non - government organization. With his help, we teach a lot of children from the slum area. Kids were really amazing and thrilled to know about various facts of Science.

<p> Formation of Nitrosamines in chlorinated water as a by-product motivated us to meet Ashutosh Kaushik, who is the Director of Treatment & Quality Control, Delhi Jal Board. He really wants the project to be in the market so that Nitrosamines from the various treatment plants in Delhi can be removed.  He wants us to work on this project further for its success </p>
